In vectorization notebook you will see how vectorization speed up your code.

Explanation: Vectorization is basically the art of getting rid of explicit for loops in your code.
We often find ourselves training on relatively large data sets, because that's the deep learning algorithms era.
And so, it's important that our code very quickly because otherwise, if it's running on a big data set,
our code might take a long time to run then we just find ourselves waiting a very long time to get the result.
So in the deep learning era,  the ability to perform vectorization has become a key skill. 

You can see how vectorization can significantly speed up your code.
The rule of thumb to remember is whenever possible, avoid using explicit for loops.
